# sign-up

## PTR-515

In order to be registered as a collaborator to this organization, you must complete *one* task detailed in the upcoming section. The tasks are allocated on a first-come first-serve basis, **one per user**.
(If there are no tasks left, you can take any task not assigned **by your team**).

## Steps

1. (If you don't have a GitHub account yet, create one using your email address and your full first and last name **in English**.- **you did**)
2. Create an [issue](https://github.com/ptr-15/sign-up-2/issues/new) detailing the desired task you wish to be assigned. Be sure to include a description of the task in your own words, to be sure that you understood what needs to be done. The first user to create an issue for a given task, will be given that tasks. If a user requests a previously allocated task, then will have to start the process over again.
3. Create a branch in this repository named `feature/my-task-name` *(using lower-kabob-case only)*, replace `my-task-name` with a short description of your task.
4. Complete the task based on its description on your branch in a sub-folder of the root of the project.
5. If you have any questions regarding the task, you can post a *comment* in the issue created during *step 2*. All comments and communication must be in English. Be sure to tag `@MentorPTR15` in your comment.
6. Once you are finished, create a [pull request](https://github.com/ptr-15/sign-up-2/compare) with your solution. Be sure to also link your *open issue* with the pull request *(using the `Closes #...`)*.
7. The task is considered complete once it was merged.
8. Good luck!

## Rules

- You are free to look at StackOverflow, GitHub, forums, documentation, etc. during the learning process. However, solutions cannot be copied from any of the abovementioned sources. **Solutions must be yours, and yours only!**
- You are to complete the assignment alone.
- You only need to provide the code used to solve the tasks and not the actual environment *(when relevant)*.
